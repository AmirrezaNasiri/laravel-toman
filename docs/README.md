Toman is a Laravel package that makes working with popular payment gateways much easier.

There are dozens of gateway handlers; Here is why you may choose Laravel Toman:

Payment is a critical topic, and its handlers must be tested from all aspects. Laravel Toman has an automated test suit with 100% coverage. On every released build, we're forced to pass all tests so you can add a payment to your code with confidence.

## Elegant API

APIs are pretty much easy to use! Requesting a new payment and verifying it will add <170 characters to your codebase! ðŸ˜Ž

## Supports Multiple Gateways

Will support indeed. We'll stick to a simple-to-use and completely-tested package, so adding new gateways may take some time.

Currently, following gateways are available to use:  
âœ… [Zarinpal.com](https://zarinpal.com)  
ðŸ”˜ [YekPay.com](https://yekpay.com/)  
ðŸ”˜ [Pay.ir](https://pay.ir/)  
ðŸ”˜ [PayPing.ir](https://www.payping.ir/)  
ðŸ”˜ ...

## Easy to Test
